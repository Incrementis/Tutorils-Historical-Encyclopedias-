# Tutorils-Historical-Encyclopedias-
## NOTE 
This is a work in progress and an alpha release. This means that most things are not implemented and the mod is subject to heavy changes. Use this mod with caution!!


## Idea
This mod is fanfiction!
It contains encyclopedias of in-game history book series to eliminate searching for the history book parts.
The books are:
* History of Shadowdale(13 Books)
* History of the Drow(2 Books)
* History of the North(10 Books)
* History of Waterdeep(6 Books)

The items can be bought in Feldepost's Inn(Beregost).

In addition, the encyclopedias have a “Reading-Sequence”(like the Dream- or Chapter-Sequence). This can be activated within the description window using the “READ” button.
The button first activates a dialog with a relatively short description and then the “Reading-Sequence”.
Each sequence is accompanied by music and voice. It should also be noted that each “Reading-Sequence” has its own background image within the sequence.

Furthermore, the encyclopedias have a custom drag-and-drop sound and the items can only be equipped in the left quickslot due to their size and weight.

Each encyclopedia has a unique icon image in its inventory.
They also share a unique ground icon with a custom highlight, showing that they are limited and magical.

A total of 21 images were created that can be found as a description image depending on the number of books an encyclopedia covers. For example, "History of the Drow" has two. Depending on the number of images that a description image must use, these are correspondingly small.

# How to use(TODO)
* Headphones recommended
* If reading and listening at the same time is wished this can be achieved by left-mouse click on the text area in "Reading Sequence"
* Take a seat in Feldepost Inn, order your drink and then enjoy. This is not kind of a "fast food" mod, so take your time while consuming(it can be very long).

## Installation
1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/Incrementis/Tutorils-Historical-Encyclopedias-/releases)
2. Unzip the file
3. Navigate into the unzipped folder until you see the "*tutorils_he*" folder.
4. Copy the folder "*tutorils_he*" and the file "*Setup-tutorils_he.exe*" and paste them into your Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition(SoD) or Icewind Dale Enhanced Edition game folder.
5. Start "*Setup-tutorils_he.exe*" and select the installation language.

## Troubleshooting
### There are known issues when installing SOD as DLC for BG:EE
Here is a solution:

* Before "Tutoril's Historical Encyclopedias" is installed(If it is already installed, uninstall it before installing SOD by launching "*Setup-tutorils_he.exe*".):
	1. SOD needs to be installed as BG:EE DLC 
	2. and after that [DLCmerger](https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases) needs to be installed.

### Compatibility
* Likely incompatible with UI mods that change chapter sequences in the UI.MENU file, or UI mods that fundamentally change the user interface of IE games.

## More Information(TODO)
### Competition
“*Tutoril's Historical Encyclopedias*” took part in the following competition:
[2024 Baldur’s Gate Community Creative Craziness Challenge](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/38732-2024-baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-community-creative-craziness-challenge/#comment-342226)

Because of this, the mod has achieved in its first alpha state the following achievements:

* "**Worth 1000 words!**"
*  Hidden achievement unlocked - "**These Walls Contain the World's Knowledge**" -- make something that heavily focuses on lore.

One of the conditions of the competition was not to use AI, which is why the goal of this mod is to develop and finish without the use of AI.

### TODO
* TODO: Link to wiki
* TODO: Effects of every encyclopedia
Still in works!
